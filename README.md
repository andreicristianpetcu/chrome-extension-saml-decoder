# SAML Message Decoder (Chrome extension)

This extension is still in its early days. Bugs are guaranteed. 

## Development

1) Get the development machine up and running. You have Virtualbox and Vagrant already installed, right?
```
vagrant up
```
Wait until the GDM login screen appears.

2) Login to the machine. Application menu items are installed for launching WebStorm (preconfigured and ready) and Dartium. 

3) In WebStorm, open up the pubspec.yaml and hit the 'Get Dependencies' text link at the top.
